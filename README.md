Are you reading Terms and Conditions when signing up the new account? Are you completely reading the Privacy Policy or Software License? Almost of us just skip that document and just click "I agree", without knowing what the service will do with our account. Legal Reader tries to eliminate that problem. It will convert your legal document that is written in markdown into more readable format and can force user to read the Terms and Conditions before clicking the submit button.

It is an easy to use jQuery plugin, so you can use it on your website with minimal coding. Developer will love it.
